# Here are a few notes about how I donwloaded genomes from NCBI using the SRA Toolkit
# I downloaded these genomes to Curie

# Example of a magnolia raw sequence data
nohup fasterq-dump SRR15412849 2>&1 &

# Way to download full genome assembly 
nohup  datasets download genome accession GCA_041380795.1 --include gff3,rna,cds,protein,genome,seq-report 2>&1 &

#Basic Work Flow
#1. Trim Raw Reads with Trimmomatic
#2.
